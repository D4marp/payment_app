# Payment App

A Flutter application demonstrating a simple payment integration using the `pay` plugin for Google Pay and Apple Pay. Built with Clean Architecture for modularity and maintainability, this project serves as a starting point for developers implementing in-app payments in Flutter.

## Features

- Integration with Google Pay (Android) and Apple Pay (iOS) using the `pay` plugin.
- Clean Architecture with separation of concerns (Presentation, Domain, Data layers).
- Dependency injection using `get_it` for loose coupling.
- Simple UI with payment buttons for initiating transactions.
- Error handling and success feedback using `setState` for lightweight state management.
- Configurable payment profiles stored in JSON assets.

## Project Structure

The project follows Clean Architecture principles to ensure scalability and testability. Below is the folder structure:

```

```

## Prerequisites

- **Flutter SDK**: Version 3.0.0 or higher.
- **Dart SDK**: Included with Flutter.
- **IDE**: Android Studio, VS Code, or any Flutter-compatible IDE.
- **Emulator/Simulator**: Android Emulator, iOS Simulator, or a physical device.
- **Payment Gateway Account**: A merchant account with a supported gateway (e.g., Stripe, Square) for production use.

## Setup Instructions

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/payment_app.git
cd payment_app
```

### Install Dependencies

Run the following command to install all required packages:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

### Configure Platform-Specific Settings

#### Android

1. Update `android/app/build.gradle` to ensure `minSdkVersion` is at least 21:

    ```gradle
    android {
         defaultConfig {
              minSdkVersion 21
              targetSdkVersion 33
              ...
         }
    }
    ```

2. Add internet permission in `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`:

    ```xml
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
    ```

#### iOS

1. Add Apple Pay capability in `ios/Runner/Info.plist`:

    ```xml
    <key>com.apple.developer.in-app-payments</key>
    <array>
         <string>merchant.com.example.payment</string>
    </array>
    ```

2. Set up a Merchant ID in the Apple Developer Console and enable Apple Pay.

### Configure Payment Profiles

Modify `assets/google_pay_config.json` and `assets/apple_pay_config.json` with your payment gateway details (e.g., `gateway`, `gatewayMerchantId`, `merchantIdentifier`). Ensure the environment in `google_pay_config.json` is set to `TEST` for development or `PRODUCTION` for release.

### Run the Application

Connect an emulator/simulator or physical device and run:

```bash
flutter run
```

## Usage

1. Launch the app to see the payment screen.
2. Click the **Google Pay** button (Android) or **Apple Pay** button (iOS) to initiate a payment.
3. The app processes a sample transaction of $99.99 (USD) and displays success or error messages.

## Notes

- **Testing**: Use test cards or sandbox accounts provided by your payment gateway for testing. Ensure the environment is set to `TEST` in `google_pay_config.json`.
- **Platform-Specific UI**: Google Pay is only available on Android, and Apple Pay is only available on iOS. Enhance the UI to conditionally display buttons using `Platform.isAndroid` or `Platform.isIOS`.
- **Production**: Update payment configurations with production credentials and test thoroughly before deployment.
- **Extensibility**: The Clean Architecture setup makes it easy to add new features or integrate additional payment providers.
